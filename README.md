# Blinds Control

### Based on the following http://lifehacker.com/control-arduino-powered-blinds-with-an-alexa-voice-comm-1771554473
### Will create push button operated servo that can be used to pull each toggle for the blinds
### Alexa voice control integration will then be implemented

#### TODO:
#### - Connect to internet
#### - extend servo arm length to pull cord properly  
#### - Alexa App
